    Linear Regression Model:
         Linear regression is a statistical method that is used to predict a continuous dependent variable (target variable) based on one or more independent variables (predictor variables). This technique assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which implies that the dependent variable changes proportionally with changes in the independent variables.

    Logistic Regression Model:
       Logistic regression is used for binary classification where we use sigmoid function, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.
For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 it belongs to Class 0. Itâ€™s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems.
