    Linear Regression Model:
         Linear regression is a statistical method that is used to predict a continuous dependent variable (target variable) based on one or more independent variables (predictor variables). This technique assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which implies that the dependent variable changes proportionally with changes in the independent variables.

    Logistic Regression Model:
       Logistic regression is used for binary classification where we use sigmoid function, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.
For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 it belongs to Class 0. Itâ€™s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems.

K-Means clustering:
    K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. The article aims to explore the fundamentals and working of k mean clustering along with the implementation.

Random Forest :

Random forests are a popular supervised machine learning algorithm.
Random forests are for supervised machine learning, where there is a labeled target variable.
Random forests can be used for solving regression (numeric target variable) and classification (categorical target variable) problems.
Random forests are an ensemble method, meaning they combine predictions from other models.
Each of the smaller models in the random forest ensemble is a decision tree.
